# Who may talk to whom on the router's own networks, below the layer where the firewall's zones work. Installed as a firewall
# hotplug script: applied again each time the firewall is reloaded; setup, update and `piso-setup wifi-admin` also run it.
# Safe to run any number of times. Two small tables, both in the bridge family:
#
#  piso_guest  Guests do not reach each other. The guest Wi-Fi keeps the clients of one radio apart, but a guest on 2.4 GHz and one
#              on 5 GHz, or anything behind an access point on a guest port, share the guest bridge. Frames for the router itself
#              (DHCP, DNS, the portal) are delivered locally and never pass this rule.
#  piso_kiosk  The kiosk network (rental phones): a phone reaches the router (internet, DHCP, DNS) and the coin box, nothing else.
#              No phone to phone, none to the print server or to computers, and none the other way except the coin box. The
#              router's own login pages (SSH, LuCI: ports 22, 80, 443, 8080, 8443) do not answer on Wi-Fi at all; a computer on a
#              LAN cable is not touched. `piso-setup wifi-admin on` lets Wi-Fi in again. Packets from Wi-Fi are also marked so the
#              firewall (rule Kiosk-Wi-Fi-No-Private) can refuse the modem's network to them.
#
# Needs the kernel's nftables bridge support (kmod-nft-bridge). Without it nothing is changed and the reason is logged; the Wi-Fi
# isolation of each radio stays as it was. `piso-setup diag` shows whether the tables are in place.
