# ---- the coin box's firmware: the router installs new releases for it ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The box cannot reach the website itself, but the router can. The box accepts an image only when the owner signed it (it checks the
# signature and the checksum of every byte itself, and goes back to its old firmware if the new one does not start), so the router is
# only the messenger: it fetches firmware.json and the image, checks the size and checksum the owner published, hands both to the box
# and waits for it to come back on the new version.
