# PisoPhone router setup: one file that turns a factory-reset OpenWrt router into the whole PisoWiFi system.
#
#   on the factory-reset router (ssh root@192.168.1.1):  wget -qO- https://pisophone.pages.dev/install.sh | sh
#   (it fetches this file, moves the router to 10.0.0.1 and tells you to log in there and run ./piso-setup.sh; setup/README.md)
#
# Before you run it: the router's LAN address is 10.0.0.1 (the installer sets it; this file never cuts your SSH session), modem in the
# router's WAN port (internet is needed once, to download packages), the ESP32 coin box flashed with the current firmware
# (or factory reset) and powered on.
#
# What it builds (the router's LAN address is not touched; your SSH session stays open the whole time):
#   PisoKiosk-xxxx    Wi-Fi, 2.4 + 5 GHz, WPA2, HIDDEN (not broadcast). For the rental phones only. Network 10.0.0.0/24 (the router's LAN).
#                     xxxx comes from this router's own MAC address, so two shops (or two routers) never share a network name.
#                     A router that was set up before keeps the name PisoKiosk.
#   PisoCoinBox-xxxx  hidden Wi-Fi, 2.4 GHz, for the ESP32 coin box only: after pairing, only the box's MAC address may join.
#                     (only while pairing it is called PisoCoinBox, the name a new box knows; then the box is told its own name)
#                The box gets the fixed address 10.0.0.10.
#   PisoWiFi     open Wi-Fi, 2.4 + 5 GHz, for customers (openNDS login page, coin payments). Rename it with:
#                  piso-setup wifi-name "My Shop"
#                Network 10.0.30.0/24, kept apart from the kiosk network.
# Everything is generated here (Wi-Fi password, box admin password, gateway key) and printed once at the end and saved in
# /root/piso-setup-summary.txt. Running the file again is safe: it keeps what it already made.
#
# Other commands (after setup): piso-setup status | wifi-name "<name>" | guest-port [lanN|off] | voucher-choice [on|off] | pair | summary | test-coin | diag | box-diag | set-password | box-wifi-name | reconcile [rebase] | telegram | rotate-box-wifi | export [file] | import <file> | space | forget-summary | kiosk-wifi | verify | handout | lock-admin | unlock-admin | wifi-admin [on|off] | update [check] (installs the newest release from the website; same as self-update) | self-update [check] | box-update [check] (installs the coin box's newest firmware) | auto-update on|off
