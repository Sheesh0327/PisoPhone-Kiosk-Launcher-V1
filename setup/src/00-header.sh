# PisoPhone router setup: one file that turns a factory-reset OpenWrt router into the whole PisoWiFi system.
#
#   on the factory-reset router (ssh root@192.168.1.1):  wget -qO- https://pisophone.pages.dev/install.sh | sh
#   (it fetches this file, moves the router to 10.0.0.1 and tells you to log in there and run ./piso-setup.sh; setup/README.md)
#
# Before you run it: the router's LAN address is 10.0.0.1 (the installer sets it; this file never cuts your SSH session), modem in the
# router's WAN port (internet is needed once, to download packages), the ESP32 coin box flashed with the current firmware
# (or factory reset) and powered on.
#
# What it builds (the router's LAN address is not touched; your SSH session stays open the whole time):
#   PisoKiosk    Wi-Fi, 2.4 + 5 GHz, WPA2, fixed name, HIDDEN (not broadcast). For the rental phones only. Network 10.0.0.0/24 (the router's LAN).
#   PisoCoinBox  hidden Wi-Fi, 2.4 GHz, for the ESP32 coin box only: after pairing, only the box's MAC address may join.
#                The box gets the fixed address 10.0.0.10.
#   PisoWiFi     open Wi-Fi, 2.4 + 5 GHz, for customers (openNDS login page, coin payments). Rename it with:
#                  piso-setup wifi-name "My Shop"
#                Network 10.0.30.0/24, kept apart from the kiosk network.
# Everything is generated here (Wi-Fi password, box admin password, gateway key) and printed once at the end and saved in
# /root/piso-setup-summary.txt. Running the file again is safe: it keeps what it already made.
#
# Other commands (after setup): piso-setup status | wifi-name "<name>" | guest-port [lanN|off] | pair | summary | test-coin | diag | box-diag | set-password | reconcile [rebase] | telegram | rotate-box-wifi | kiosk-wifi | verify | handout | lock-admin | unlock-admin | update [check] (installs the newest release from the website; same as self-update) | self-update [check] | auto-update on|off
#
# Options:  --dry-run  print the router settings instead of applying them (needs nothing but the uci command)
#           --yes      do not ask for confirmation
# Settings can be overridden from the environment: COUNTRY (default PH) GUEST_SSID BOX_IP GUEST_IP ROOT_PASSWORD KIOSK_PASSWORD BOX_NEW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
